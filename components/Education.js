          The Software Development Mastermind Program is a rigorous, hands-on
          mentorship program I attended for 32 weeks. The program simulates a
          work environment by focusing on building real-world projects under
          deadlines. There is constant feedback, coaching and code reviews
          throughout the process. It has helped to refine and enhance my problem
          solving skills, strengthen my developer approach and trust the
          continuous learning process.
